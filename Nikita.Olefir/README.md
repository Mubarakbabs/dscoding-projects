# Chess Opening Selection System

By Nikita Olefir

## Goal of the project

To create a system that is to select an opening for a chess player based on several factors:

1) The ELO rating of the player (it shows how skillful the player is).
2) The side person plays (either for white or black pieces).
3) The preferred game type (consult with [this source](https://chessfox.com/13-different-types-of-chess-openings/#Flank-Openings)).
4) Initial steps of the opponent.
5) Preference about the lenght of the game (in terms of turns per game)

## Data

I use the [following Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess) that is availabvle online. It contains more that 20 000 chess games played on Lichess website (one of the largest website where people can freely play chess online)
